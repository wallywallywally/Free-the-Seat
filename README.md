Use Cases:

<h2> User who wants to reserve a seat before going to the library so they can secure a seat to study </h2>
After logging into the web app, the user can select a duration of studying and a start time. Afterwards, they would be presented with a map of seats that are not reserved in that tim e period. The user can then select that seat, where they will be presented with another screen that shows the availablity of that seat over the rest of the day, as well as a button to reserve that seat. 
Upon clicking that button, that seat is now reserved for that user at that time period. The user can then continue to select more reservations in a day. All reservations will be displayed on the main page to help the user remember which their reservations. 

At the timing of the users reservations, a red light will be turn on at the users seat to deter walk in users from sitting at that seat. When the user reaches the seat, the user has to check in by scanning the QR code, which is unique to each seat, and logging into the same account they used to reserve it. Upon checking in, the light turns off so it is not disruptive to the users studying. 

However, if the user fails to reach their reserved seat 15 minutes after the start of the reserved time slot, the resrvation is cancelled and the light is turned off 



User who walks into the library, unaware of the reserving system or who just want a seat for a short period of time
